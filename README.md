php-passwordstrengh
===================

passwordstrength PHP backend

This package provides a backend checking of the strength of a password, that is compatible with the passwordstrength jQuery plugin.

It means you can not only tell a user what strength their password is, as they type it, but also enforce a minimum strength as a policy on submitted passwords.

See https://github.com/n0nick/password_strength

It is not PSR-0 at this stage - it is just a dump of what I have written for a specific project. It can be tidied up in time.

The package as it sits at this time, is writtem for FuelPHP 1.2
